        <p>        Rail Manager is an application which deals with intermodal routes on Rail i.e. here the load is transported through trains.

    <p>
        It starts with ingate call where the load comes to intermodal origin stop and after reaching the origin, the Arrival (AL) call is made i.e. load is at the train which will be the origin stop. Then, Departure call (R or PL) is called where load is dispatched to destination. In between the transportation several resources are attached and removed like CI, chassis â€¦etc. and after reaching the destination grounding call (UR) is called i.e. 
        load is completed and removed from the rail.
